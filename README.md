## Question

Work / Project Examples

Provide up to three examples of work/projects that you've recently participated in and provide detailed information about your role and contributions to the project.

## Answer

1. NYC Sports I solely built from concept to full deployment. The reason why I built this app is due to my classmates in my bootcamp and I wanting to play basketball near our bootcamp. However, if you put basketball into google maps you get recreational centers and to get to a public park you'd have to scroll quite a bit through. An alternative would be to use nyc.gov website but to find a sport, you first have to click through multiple parks and even if you find your park, you won't remember where it was and if you liked it.

The solution I data scraped from https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/ for all public parks and the sports they contain, created a RESTful API, implemented google maps geolocation and distance matrix api as well as integrated address querying and favorite functionality. This way when a user goes to my site, they create a profile, search by sport and upon entering their address, the list of public parks is re-evaluated for the walking distance and milage to the users address inputed. In addition some parks have more info data, such as times and amount of courts, and if the user likes the park, they can add it to their favorites so they know which park to revisit at a future time.

2. Pagination is a project that I built based on a coding challenge. The challenge was to make a call to an api that has thousands of images. Now if I was to load a 1000 images on my site, no one would scroll down to see them all, so the solution was to implement a custom pagination. Upon searching google for ideas on the best way to create pagination and seeing custom libraries, I realized the best way would be to use logical javascript, hence I implemented a formula that would only load 20 images at a time, and that could be simply changed by changing one variable in my code, hence making it dynamic at the same time.

## Question

Inspiration

Provide up to three examples of work that has recently inspired you from a technical perspective. These can be open source projects, CodePens/CodeSandboxes, blog posts, etc. Be sure to include specifics on what you found inspiring.

## Answer

1. Shante Austin started a trend on Linkedin called 30 app challenge, upon seeing some amazing projects on Linkedin referencing the challenge I decided to parktake in it as well. There was one person on Linkedin who created a Financial Expense calculator app using chart.js library. Coming from a financial accounting field with a developer skillset, I saw it as the perfect marriage of both of my skills. Budgeting and breaking down your expenses can be boring and tiresome, but implementing visuals is a lot of fun. So I implemented a line graph to break down each of your individual expense, as well as a pie chart to show you live breakdown of your savings vs expenses. The best part is that if you make a mistake when entering your numbers, you can simply delete it and my app instantly recalculates it for you.

2. Fahad Haidari is one of my inspirations for when it comes to pure javascript code. One of his projects entitled Pixel Fun, link provided below, lets you select a certain part of a picture and based on your selection, that chosen part will be reflected as its own picture to the side. In addition, he is using Canvas, which is on my list of libraries to implement and learn. I think its ingenious idea, as it's a fun and interesting way to zoom in on an image. For instance if you were to make a game of Where's Waldo, or a detective mystery game, this would help you perfectly find out the hidden secrets.

## Question

Focus

If you were given the time and resources to build/learn anything you wanted during your internship, where would you choose to focus your efforts? Provide a brief description of how you would spend your time.

## Answer

Critical Mass offers a unique opportunity to work on a wide array of projects, personally the UNMAS app that was created for United Nations is very eye opening and is a grim reminder of my trip to Angkor Wat and Cambodia, where I saw the beauty and mystery of Cambodia, but due to massive landmines spread throughout the country there is and will be unexplored ruins, history and landmark for years to come.

If given a chance to learn anything, I definitely want to dive into three.js or a 3D based app or AR based app. The main reason why I got into Full Stack Development is to be in the forefront of technology, and although 3D, AR, VR, and MR have been out for a while, the market has yet to fully adopt them. Being a Full Stack Developer means I am able to bring concepts to full deployment, the only thing that I can think better than 2D is 3D and on. In order to make this a reality I would start with three.js as it tends to be the major underliner for 3D based applications. 

## Question
Code Challenge

Please fork the following CodeSandbox project, follow the instructions provided in the README.md file in the project, and do your best to complete the challenge. When you are finished, provide a link to your solution in your README.md file of your GitHub repository. Be prepared to walk through your solution and explain the rationale behind your solution.
